00a - download and transform level 2 bottom temp data

00b - accessing area of ROMS grid cells

00c - merge area and bottom temp dfs and trim by shelf region and depth

00d -  calculate hatch success

start with these files:

01 - run this script to load libraries, helpful functions, data (hatch success and habitat suitability)

02 - code for mapping monthly-averaged habitat suitability for each year 

03 - estimating and plotting mean latitude

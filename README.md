# Pcod-Bering-Sea 

This repo houses code for the EBS Pacific Cod habitat suitability project

key to files:

preprocessing -- do not need to run

00a - download and transform level 2 bottom temp data

00b - accessing area of ROMS grid cells

00c - merge area and bottom temp dfs and trim by shelf region and depth

00d -  calculate hatch success

start with these files:

01 - run this script to load libraries, helpful functions, data (hatch success and habitat suitability)

02 - code for mapping monthly-averaged habitat suitability and temperature for each year for both projections and hindcasts

03 - calculating spawning habitat suitability indices

04 - calculating mean latitude metrics

05 - calculating area metrics

06 - calculating rollig means and sds

07 - calculating region-specific metrics

08 - mapping consistency of spawning habitat suitability
